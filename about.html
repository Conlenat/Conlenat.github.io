        <h2>The Person Behind the Site</h2>
        <p>
          Overall i'm pretty quiet, although I work well in both groups and solo. However, when trying to achieve a goal, I'm quite competitive. I'm a middle of the road geek. I don't follow star trek but most other things, i'm going to know a little too much about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through most of my life I was pretty deadset on going into physics as a major in college, but a high school teacher, if they taught me one thing, taught me that I didn't really want to do math for the rest of my life.I then figured that with my love for computers and the huge number of opportunities, Computer Science would be the next best thing. Thus, I am a broke college student hoping that maybe I won't have to live off of ramen noodles using the programming that I've learned.
